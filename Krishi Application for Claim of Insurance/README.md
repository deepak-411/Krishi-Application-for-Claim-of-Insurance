## Details
The <b>Government of rajasthan </b>has enrolled multiple farmers across the state under the <b>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana </b> this year. The number of enrollments has been increasing every year and the Government hopes <b>to reach more farmers in a short time</b>. 

Even though the scheme has been designed to be pro-farmer, there have been <b>operational issues in the field</b>. One such challenging problem is the <b>delayed settlement of insurance claims</b> and their rejection by insurance companies. Insurance companies are yet to clear <b>almost 33 percent of estimated claims</b> to the framers who come under the PMFBY.  Due to these issues the state has witnessed farmer agitations about the lack of clarity in the settlement and <b>disbursement of insurance claims</b>. <br>

## Solution
Building <b> Krishi Application for Claim of Insurance </b>( where farmers can register, claim and track claim as well as government authorities can monitor, regulate and report actions taken), that is efficient enough to deal with the <b>farmer insurance claims</b>.
We intend to adopt a <b> decentralised blockchain approach </b> to fix the glitch caused by <b>insurance companies</b> while settling claims, making each claim get <b>settled at 2x faster rate</b>. <br>

<b> Krishi Application for Claim of Insurance Machine Learning model </b> will reduce the troubles arising on the field while <b> predicting the crop damage</b>. Ekaci will give the farmers the <b> liberty to upload and report the loss and provide prediction </b>, if he/she is eligible for <b> receiving insurance sum </b> with the help of sensors.
